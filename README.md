Lightbird is a SeaMonkey extension that aims to provide conventional interface for Lightning calendar.
It is based on Sunbird code, and requires Lightning to work. Since it's just UI, it doesn't contain any binary components.

It disables default Lightning UI, but there is an option on Calendar preferences pane to re-enable it 

It does not work with Thunderbird. For Thunderbird normal Lightning UI is fine, while for SeaMonkey it isn't. Since Thunderbird support requires additional effort here, I don't support it.
